Top Drill: Try this simple drill to create a great starting position which will make it easier to develop a consistent putting stroke free of compensations and inconsistencies. Three easy steps to better putting.

1. Standing tall hold the putter out in front of you.

2. Draw your elbows into the front of your rib cage. Your forearms and the putter will be level. Upper arms are close to your body and elbows are into your sides. This connects your arms and your upper body so they can function together.

3. Maintain that "connected triangle" and just tilt forward to the ball. Looking at the set up position that I am in you will notice how this drill achieved all the key fundamentals of great putters. Try this next time you go out to practice, which will help you get into a solid set up position, which will make stroking the putt the easy part.
